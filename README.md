# HCI1
HCI homework

This repository contains a static, mobile-sized HTML mock of the Path@Penn registration left sidebar for the HCI Assignment 1 (Stage 4: Implementation). It mirrors the provided screenshot and demonstrates a clean, accessible layout suitable for phone dimensions without external dependencies.

File: path.html

Tech: Plain HTML

Goal: Provide a static, high-fidelity scaffold that can be extended into an interactive prototype (e.g., adding flows for filters, search, and chat).


Getting Started

Open locally

Double-click path.html in any modern browser.

Edit

Open in a text editor (VS Code, Sublime, etc.). All styles live in the <style> block in the <head>.

File Structure (Single-File)

<head>

CSS variables (:root) for brand colors and radii

Base styles for page background and the phone frame

Component styles for the pill, search card, CTAs, filter list, and chat tile

<body>

.phone container (simulated device frame)

.sidebar block (red background)

Child elements in order: Pill → Search Card → CTAs → Filters → Chat
